    		<p id="book-description"> To Kill a Mockingbird is written by Harper Lee. This is a great book that teaches us a great deal about racism and prejudice in the deep south. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film. Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, To Kill a Mockingbird follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman.</p>
